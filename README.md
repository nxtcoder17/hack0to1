#### **Idea**
+ Suppose a person prepares a shopping list

+ When, the person is just walking and sort of within 100 metres radius of any store that has any item from that list, the person  is notified with the info like "This product is available nearby @ price Rs. <value>"

+ If the item is not present, then notify the shopkeeper's about the listed item is not in their Inventory

+ .... 

#### How To

+ Users do carry their SMART PHONES everywhere, so we can retrieve user's current location with the help of his smart phones
+ Then, our program would fetch their locations, and perform their procedure of finding local stores where this items are available, and inform the user about that (maybe, just text them or send a mail to them)

+ And, in case item is not available, try pushing that info to the ShopOwner too.

+ ... 


#### Goals

+ Figure out a way, to fetch user's current geological location
+ Then, something (a database like) where we would store the Shops, their geological co-ordinates (Longitude and Latitude) and their inventory list those will sell their products through us.
+ Then, a procedure to figure out distance b/w user and shops
+ Then, an algorithm to check if an item is present or not
+ Then, a way to inform the user or the shops about availability/unavailabilty of an item in the store
+ ... 

##### Technology Used
+ Python, Flask
